## Implementing a web component to create links for the post form

The notes from the satisfactory project were:

## News links

Here is the code that assembled the two links.

```js
  ngOnInit() {
    const dashTitle = this.trendTitleSeen.split(' ').join('-');
    this.newNewsLink = 'https://apnews.com/hub/' + dashTitle;
    this.handleNewAPSearchTerm.emit(this.newNewsLink);
    this.newWikiSearchTerm = this.trendTitleSeen;
    this.wikiBaseUrl = 'https://en.wikipedia.org';
    if (this.topicForm.controls.country.value === 'KR') {
      this.wikiBaseUrl = 'https://ko.wikipedia.org';
      console.log('using KOREAN', this.wikiBaseUrl);
    } else {
      console.log('using ENGLISH', this.wikiBaseUrl);
    }
  }
```

Based on this I came up with this basic data model.

```json
links = [
  {
    type: APNewsLink,
    baseUrl: 'https://apnews.com/hub/',
    title: "AP News",
  },
  {
    type: 'WikipediaLink',
    baseUrl: 'https://en.wikipedia.org',
    title: "Wikipedia",
  },
]
```

## NavBar tests

When fixing the NavBar tests, the key lessons from this debugging session were:

```txt
- Mocking context hooks directly can be more reliable than using Providers in tests
- Using href to find links is more reliable than text matching when icons are involved
- Storing mock functions in variables makes them easier to verify
- The first passing test can be a good guide for fixing failing ones
- Sleep well! ðŸŒ™
```

Currently the src\components\WebComponents\LinkSelector\LinkSelector.js does not reflect the selected choice.
We also want to pass in a search string which can be used to construct a link to display under the select component.

Lets practice TDD here.
First, write a failing test to check that the first item in the link data model is preselected and shown in a string below the selector.

I have some old code which contains the business logic for constructing the links:

```js
  ngOnInit() {
    const dashTitle = this.trendTitleSeen.split(' ').join('-');
    this.newNewsLink = 'https://apnews.com/hub/' + dashTitle;
    this.handleNewAPSearchTerm.emit(this.newNewsLink);
    this.newWikiSearchTerm = this.trendTitleSeen;
    this.wikiBaseUrl = 'https://en.wikipedia.org';
    if (this.topicForm.controls.country.value === 'KR') {
      this.wikiBaseUrl = 'https://ko.wikipedia.org';
      console.log('using KOREAN', this.wikiBaseUrl);
    } else {
      console.log('using ENGLISH', this.wikiBaseUrl);
    }
  }
```

In this case, the title will be coming from the src\pages\posts\PostCreateForm.js title field.

As the user types in that field, it should update the link displayed with the correct url as described in the old code above.
